# Specification Quality Checklist: Game Start & Drawer Flow

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: Thursday, Jun 4, 2026
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation iteration 1: all items pass
- 2026-06-04: Aligned with room-management FR-016/FR-017 — trim only; no backend defaults; duplicates allowed
- Deterministic word rule: room code only (participant list and join order ignored); algorithm in `plans/002-game-start-drawer/research.md`
- Specification is ready for `/speckit-plan`
